**Indian Premier League**   
This project was opened initially to track and pridict for the IPL 2020. Now, we aim to take it forward for 2021 as well.  
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional **Twenty20** cricket league in India contested during March or **April** and April-May of every year by **eight teams** representing eight different cities or states in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008.  
  
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.   
The **brand value** of the IPL in 2019 was **US$ 6.7 billions**, according to Duff & Phelps, the 2015 IPL season alone contributed US$160 million to the GDP of the Indian economy.   
  
There have been twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the **Mumbai Indians**, who won the 2019 season. The venue for the 2020 season has been moved, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; games will now take place in the United Arab Emirates from 19 September through 10 November.

This project aims to collect the various data related to _**Indian Premier League**_ regardless of any particular season. Our basic focus is to bring **unseen facts** through visualizing the various data figures, so that we can avail a range of good ideas & scopes about the possible data science work.  

<!--
## Scope of this repository
Our data analysis can be carried out in order to acheive the following outcomes:
a) How long (in terms of runs) a partnership between batsmen can go if provided boller is bolling currently
b) Hence, how much a team can score in an inning or 1st powerplay (provided data of first over)
c) We can make a ML model to predict the final ranking of the teams in points-table by the end of current season (based on the stats and data about the results of the previous few matches)..... and many more...

Let's know your ideas as well....

## Wanna Contribute? ✨
  
It'd be great to join us and work toward some outstanding Data Science & AI/ML projects.  
Let's introduce a quick guide to being towards the contribution!!  

### Getting Started 🐢

 Just going through a certain steps, you can easily begin with your work!  
 Have a glimpse below:  

 1. **Grab the Data:**  
 Explore the various datasets available in the [```Datasets```](https://github.com/Team-thedatatribune/IPL-Analysis/tree/dataset-defination) directory.  
 You can contribute by adding your own dataset to this branch, as well!!  

 2. **Code Parallelly**  
 Find the dataset that interests you and begin with the codes to analyse the data.  
 You can share your code regardless of the language you use to code.  

 3. **Add Visualizations**  
 You can do exploratory data analysis on the datasets and create nice graphs or other visualizations too that can bring good insights.  
 Visualization would make it more easy to understand the datasets.  

 4. **Work Independently**  
 If you are confident enough in some other field say documentation/content-presentation or enhencement, you are most welcome.  
 You can also contribute with any other work, apart from those which are mentioned above. Just, make sure they are relavent to this project.

### Folder Conventions 📂

This project has **two** branches:  

> 1. **master** :  
>   _It's the default and the main branch of the project_
> 2. **dataset-definations** :  
>   _This branch basically holds the datasets and their proper documentations_
